Got no reason for coming to me
And the rain running down
There's no reason

And the same voice
Comin' to me
like it's all slowin' down
And believe me

I was the one who let you know
I was your "sorry ever after"
'74-'75

It's not easy
Nothin' to say 'cause it's already said
It's never easy
When I look on your eyes
Then I find that I'll do fine
When I look on your eyes
Then I'll do better
